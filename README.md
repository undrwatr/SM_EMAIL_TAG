This script can be called from our web service and will remove and add tags based on the device serial number that we are using. Found this very useful to give our helpdesk the ability to reset passwords for our ipad users. Sometimes they need to just have the profile reset which allows the user to put in their passwords again. Since we have everything locked down this is a nice work around to allow things to work and yet again another way that my HD doesn't need to contact me for something.
